> querySelector(); for further JS action
  you can use a canvas, or choose not to, 
  we'll get HTML element by querySelector(); to do further manipulation

> htmlElement.style.bottom = .. manipulate css properties

> DOMContentLoaded - safe method to load JS after html finished loading
  as we need to select certain elements from HTML,
  to avoid scenario where HTML not finished loaded and we run JS, not able to fetch desired ele.
  add a layer of check using event: DOMContentLoaded

> to avoid another jump happens when jump happens, 
  no jump when jumpStatus = true

> setInterval for position-change event,
  clearInterval when certain height is reached (or other criteria)

> clearTimeout

> window.screen.width
  window.innerWidth
  document.documentElement.clientWidth

  <body onresize="myFunction()">
  w = w || window; (take the current window, if undefined, use window)

> getComputedStyle(dino).bottom.replace("px","");
  to read CSS properties value into javascript,
  -> dino_y = getComputedStyle(dino).bottom.replace("px","");
  -> cannot use dino.style.bottom (this is only to write)

> to reload the page,
  onClick="document.location.reload(true)"

> visibility: hidden; //hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout.
  display: none; // turns off the display and removes the element completely from the document.
